## Description
This project is a free, open-source script to be ran in the command line.\n
It works best when ran in gitbash, and requires some knowledge of command line prompts as well as markdown.\n
If you do not know much about writing your own markdown, I would recommend practicing writing your own before using any generators, including mine.\n
[Here is a good source to get started.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
## Installation
### FOR WINDOWS
You must make sure to have [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
### FOR MAC & LINUX
Your terminal will work just fine, although I still recommend using [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
### Node.js & npm
If you do not already have Node.js with npm installed, please follow [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install the latest LTS version.
### README-generator
Make sure to [download](https://github.com/Fiskoal/README-generator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and save the README-generator file to somewhere you will remember, refer to usage for instructions.
## Usage
Please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/7KLwKdHe6O8) for a full tutorial on how to run the script.
If you don't want to or cant watch the video...
        1. Open Git Bash [(git bash docs here)](https://git-scm.com/docs)\n
        2. Navigate inside the README-generator file (for example `cd /c/users/me/desktop/README-generator`)\n
        3. Install packages (Inquirer) with `npm i`\n
        4. Wait for Inquirer to install (git bash will throw you into a new line when done)\n
        5. You are now ready to run the generator with the command `node index.js`!\n
